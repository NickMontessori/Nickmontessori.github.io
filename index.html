            Hey everyone!<br>
        this is the work tutorial website for Providence: A Christan Montessori Community!<br>
            this webpage is designed to meet the needs of the teachers of Providence but if you've stumbled upon this page then feel free to to read and learn about montessori<br>
            Montessori is a type of school that honors the child and what he or she needs to be succesful.<br>
            We at Providence use materials to teach children things like long division or color charts or even basic motor movements for younger children
            in an easier way for them to understand. this website has many works that we use
            <br> click the works below for tutorials on how to use them.
