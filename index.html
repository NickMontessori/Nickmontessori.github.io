            Hey everyone!<br>
        this is the work tutorial website for Providence: A Christan Montessori Community!<br>
            this webpage is designed to meet the needs of the teachers of Providence but if you've stumbled upon this page then feel free to to read and learn about montessori<br>
            Montessori is a type of school that honors the child and what he or she needs to be succesful.<br>
            We at Providence use materials to teach children things like long division or color charts or even basic motor movements for younger children
            in an easier way for them to understand.
            <br> here are some examples below.
